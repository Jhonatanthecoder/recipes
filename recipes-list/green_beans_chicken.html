    <h2>How to make Green Beans and Chicken step-by-step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine chicken, mirin, cornstarch, salt, and white pepper in a bowl. Stir to combine and set aside while 
            preparing the rest of the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together oyster sauce, mirin, rice wine vinegar, honey, soy sauce, cornstarch, and sesame oil in a bowl
            until evenly combined. Set sauce aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut green beans in half and set aside. Slice onion in half, then cut into 1/4-inch wedges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 
            minute. Add green beans and continue cooking and stirring for 2 minutes. Pour in water and continue cooking 
            until water is evaporated and beans are crisp-tender, about 2 more minutes. Remove green bean mixture to a 
            large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same wok over high heat. Cook chicken for 1 minute in a single layer 
            without disturbing. You may need to cook the chicken in two batches, depending on the size of your wok, to 
            not overcrowd it. Flip chicken over and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add in garlic and stir frequently for 2 
            minutes. Add green bean mixture back into wok, followed by the sauce. Stir to combine and cook for 1 to 2 
            more minutes until heated through and sauce is thickened.
